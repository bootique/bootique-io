## What is This About?

We (the Bootique project) happily accept code and documentation contributions from the community. So what
do you need to do to get your pull request approved? Other then the technical merit of each pull request,
we will ask for one more thing. You need to do it only once. We need a form from you that documents the
terms of your contributions. This is how we can ensure that Bootique as a whole can be distributed under
the Apache license. This protects you and protects all Bootique users.

Obvious contributions (such as fixing typos, reformatting the code, etc.) DO NOT require a CLA. Any
changes in functionality DO require it. Please download a copy of the CLA form following the link below,
fill in the information, sign, scan (or take a picture) and email it to the address specified in the form.
